# React + Vite
.
use npm run dev to start the project

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



implemtation of the use context hook in react js


The useContext hook in React allows you to share data between components without having to pass the data through each level of the 
component tree manually (i.e., prop drilling). It's typically used with the React Context API to manage global state or shared data 
across your application.


Steps to Implement useContext in React:
Create the Context: First, you need to create a context using React.createContext().
Create a Context Provider: Wrap your component tree with a Context Provider so that components can access the context value.
Consume the Context: Use useContext inside a functional component to consume the context and access the data.
